# Lokatani IoT Weight and Image Management Backend

Backend API for Lokatani's IoT-based smart scales. This service acts as the central hub, handling data ingestion from IoT devices, managing weighing sessions (both standard product and 'rompes' types), providing secure user access via Firebase Authentication, storing data securely in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services (Firestore and Cloud Storage), and performing ML-based vegetable identification using a local YOLO model.

Built with Flask, Gunicorn, and leveraging Firebase Authentication, Google Cloud Firestore, and Google Cloud Storage. Designed for serverless deployment on Google Cloud Run.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **IoT Data Ingestion:** Receive weight data and device status updates from IoT scales via a dedicated, API-key-secured endpoint.
*   **Unified Weighing Sessions:** Support for standard product weighing sessions and specialized 'rompes' sessions, managing their lifecycle and data within Firestore.
*   **Image Upload & Storage:** Securely upload images (associated with sessions) and store them in designated Google Cloud Storage buckets.
*   **Firebase Authentication:** Secure user access to non-IoT API endpoints using Firebase ID tokens.
*   **User Profile Management:** Store and retrieve user profiles in Firestore, linked to Firebase UIDs.
*   **ML Vegetable Identification:** Process uploaded images using a YOLO model downloaded from GCS to identify vegetable types within the images.
*   **Weighing Session Management API:** Endpoints for authenticated users to initiate (handled by IoT device via active session mechanism), complete, view history, and get detailed information about their weighing sessions.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Protect API endpoints from excessive requests to ensure stability and prevent abuse.
*   **CORS Enabled:** Allow frontend applications hosted on different origins to securely interact with the API.
*   **Google Cloud Integration:** Seamless integration with core GCP services: Firestore (database), Cloud Storage (file storage), and Cloud Run (serverless deployment).
*   **Jakarta Timezone Standard:** All timestamps stored and managed by the backend adhere to the Jakarta timezone (UTC+7) for consistency with local operations.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The system follows a microservice-like pattern, with the Flask backend serving as a central API gateway and processing engine.

*   **API Layer:** Flask handles incoming HTTP requests from both IoT devices and frontend user applications.
*   **Authentication/Authorization:** Firebase Authentication secures user endpoints, while a custom API key validates IoT device requests. Role-based access control is available via Firestore user profiles.
*   **Business Logic:** Service modules encapsulate logic for processing IoT data, managing weighing sessions, interacting with GCP services, and executing ML inference.
*   **Data Storage:**
    *   **Firestore:** Used for structured data like user profiles, weighing session metadata, and individual weight records within sessions.
    *   **Cloud Storage:** Used for storing larger binary data, specifically uploaded images associated with sessions and the ML model file (`best.pt`).
*   **ML Processing:** The YOLO model is downloaded from Cloud Storage to the `/tmp` directory (Cloud Run's writable filesystem) upon application startup or first use, allowing for low-latency local inference.
*   **Deployment:** The application is containerized using Docker and deployed to Google Cloud Run, leveraging its serverless, autoscaling capabilities. Gunicorn is used as the production WSGI server within the container.

This architecture provides scalability, leverages managed GCP services for data persistence, and separates concerns between the API, business logic, and infrastructure interactions.

## üåä Data Flow

1.  **IoT Device Interaction:**
    *   IoT device sends weight data or status updates to `/api/iot/*` endpoints.
    *   Backend validates API key.
    *   `iot_service` processes data and writes to Firestore (e.g., `weights` subcollection, `iot_devices` collection).
    *   IoT device queries `/api/iot/active-session`.
    *   `iot_service` queries Firestore for 'in_progress' sessions and returns the most recent.
2.  **Frontend User Interaction:**
    *   User logs in via Firebase Auth on the frontend, obtains an ID token.
    *   Frontend sends requests to `/api/auth/*`, `/api/weighing/*`, `/api/ml/*`, `/api/rompes/*` with the Firebase ID token in the `Authorization` header.
    *   `firebase_middleware` intercepts the request, verifies the token with Firebase Auth SDK, and retrieves/creates the user profile in Firestore via `user_service`.
    *   Validated requests proceed to the respective route handlers.
    *   Routes call `services` (e.g., `user_service`, `service`).
    *   `services` interact with Firestore (profiles, sessions, history) and Cloud Storage (image uploads, ML model).
    *   ML routes (`/api/ml/identify-vegetable`, `/api/rompes/process`) trigger ML model loading (from GCS if not cached) and inference via `service`.
    *   Results are returned to the frontend.

## üîå Integration Points

*   **Firebase Authentication:** Used directly via the `firebase-admin` SDK for verifying user ID tokens received from frontend clients and managing user records (implicitly via profile get/create).
*   **Google Cloud Firestore:** The primary database for structured data including user profiles, weighing session metadata, and detailed weight records. Accessed via `google-cloud-firestore` SDK.
*   **Google Cloud Storage:** Used for storing uploaded images (associated with sessions) and hosting the ML model file (`best.pt`) for backend download. Accessed via `google-cloud-storage` SDK.
*   **Google Cloud Run:** The target environment for serverless deployment of the Docker container. The application is designed to be stateless (except for the `/tmp` filesystem for the ML model) to leverage Cloud Run's scaling.

## üèéÔ∏è Performance Considerations

*   **Cloud Run Scaling:** The serverless nature of Cloud Run allows the application to scale horizontally based on request load. However, cold starts can occur, particularly impacting latency for the first request after a period of inactivity.
*   **ML Model Loading:** The ML model (`best.pt`) is downloaded from Cloud Storage to the `/tmp` directory. This download happens either on application startup or the first time the model is needed. This can contribute to cold start latency on ML-heavy endpoints, especially if the container instance has been idle and spun down. Subsequent ML requests on an active container instance will use the cached model in `/tmp`.
*   **Gunicorn Workers:** The `Dockerfile` specifies `gunicorn` with multiple workers (`-w 2`), allowing the application to handle concurrent requests efficiently within a single container instance. `--max-requests` and `--max-requests-jitter` are used to mitigate potential memory leaks or resource exhaustion by periodically restarting workers.
*   **Database/Storage Latency:** Performance for data operations depends on Firestore and Cloud Storage read/write speeds and data modeling efficiency.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Flask-Limiter is used to prevent excessive requests from individual IP addresses, protecting backend resources.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Aspects

*   **Firebase Authentication:** User-facing APIs are protected by validating Firebase ID tokens, ensuring only authenticated users can access their data and perform permitted actions.
*   **API Key Authorization:** IoT-specific endpoints are secured using a shared secret API key, validated via a custom decorator, preventing unauthorized devices from injecting data or querying sessions.
*   **Role-Based Authorization:** The framework includes an `@admin_required` decorator, allowing specific routes to be restricted to users with an 'admin' role defined in their Firestore profile.
*   **Input Validation:** Request data, including JSON payloads and uploaded files, is validated (`validators.py`) to prevent common vulnerabilities like injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
*   **Secure Credential Handling:** The application utilizes Google Cloud service accounts with scoped permissions to access GCP and Firebase services. While local `.env` files are used for configuration locally, sensitive credentials should be stored securely in managed services like Google Cloud Secret Manager in production deployments and accessed by the Cloud Run service account.
*   **CORS:** Flask-CORS is configured to control which origins are allowed to make requests to the API, preventing unauthorized cross-origin access.
